# Medical-Report-predication-with-deep-learning

The rapid and successful development of deep learning in research fields such as
Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has found an
important application area in healthcare. Research over the last five years shows a
clear improvement in detection by computer vision, specifically in disease
prediction from medical images.

In the medical field physicians examine patients by its medical report, and it is
more important physicians have good experience and The lack of specialist
physicians is even more critical in resource-limited countries when A.I comes and
performs great.
